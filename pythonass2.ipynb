        "\n",
        "    A data structure is a way of organizing, storing, and managing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. We can study how the data is arranged in memory and how operations like insertion, deletion, and searching are performed.\n",
        "    They are important because:\n",
        "    They help optimize operations like searching, sorting, and accessing data.Proper data structures help in efficient memory usage, reducing wastage and enhancing performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples\n",
        "\n",
        "    Mutable data types can be modified after creation whereas immutable datatypes cannot be modified after creation.In mutable data types changes in value occur in the same memory location whereas in immutable data types a new memory location is assigned for modified values.\n",
        "    Example of Mutable data type:\n",
        "    my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "    print(id(my_list))  # Memory address before modification\n",
        "    my_list.append(4)  # Modifying the list\n",
        "    print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "    print(id(my_list))  # Memory address remains the same\n",
        "    Example of immutable data type:\n",
        "    my_string = \"Hello\"\n",
        "    print(id(my_string))  # Memory address before modification\n",
        "    my_string = my_string + \" World\"  # Modifying the string\n",
        "    print(my_string)  # Output: \"Hello World\"\n",
        "    print(id(my_string))  # Memory address changes\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    lists are mutable where as tuples are immutable.lists are not hashable (Cannot be used as dictionary keys) where as tuples are hashable if containing only immutable elements (Can be used as dictionary keys).lists uses more memory whereas tuples uses less memory relatively.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Describe how dictionaries store data.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Dictionary stores data in key-value pairs. It allows for fast retrieval, insertion, and deletion using a hash table.\n",
        "    example of how dictionary stores the data:\n",
        "    student = {\"name\": \"Alice\",\"age\": 21,\"grade\": \"A\"}\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    set is an unordered, mutable collection that only stores unique elements. It is backed by a hash table, making lookups and operations like membership testing much faster than lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
        "\n",
        "    A string in Python is an immutable sequence of characters enclosed in quotes ('', \"\", or \"\"\" \"\"\"). It is used to store text data.\n",
        "    string is immutable where as lists are mutable.strings store only characters where aas lists stores any data type (for example characters,integers,lists,boolean and etc)\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    By the following ways tuples ensure data integrity in Pyhton:\n",
        "    - Once created, tuple elements cannot be altered, preventing unintended modifications.\n",
        "    - Hashability: Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries (if they contain only immutable elements), ensuring reliable key-value associations.\n",
        "    - Functions returning tuples ensure that data remains unchanged, avoiding unexpected modifications.\n",
        "    - ince tuples cannot change, they prevent data corruption in concurrent programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs using a hash function to map keys to unique memory locations. This allows for fast data retrieval (O(1) average time complexity).In Python, the built-in dict (dictionary) is implemented using a hash table, making key-based lookups extremely efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    yes,lists can contain different data types in python.\n",
        "    example:\n",
        "    my_list=[1,\"alice\",2+3j,True,[1,2,3]]\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    strings are immutable in python because:\n",
        "    - Memory Efficiency (String Interning): Python reuses string objects to optimize memory usage.\n",
        "    - Strings are widely used in hashing (e.g., dictionary keys).If a string could be modified after being used as a dictionary key, it would break the hash table\n",
        "    - Since strings cannot be modified, they are thread-safe, meaning they can be shared across threads without risk of unexpected changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Dictionaries (dict) and lists (list) are both used to store collections of data, but dictionaries offer significant advantages in certain tasks due to their key-value structure and hash table implementation.\n",
        "12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Imagine you're developing a GPS tracking application that stores latitude and longitude coordinates. Since these coordinates should never change, using a tuple ensures data integrity.we use tuple for the following reasons\n",
        "     - Immutability – Prevents accidental modification of coordinates.\n",
        "     - Faster Performance – Tuples use less memory and access is slightly faster than lists.\n",
        "     - Hashability – Tuples can be used as dictionary keys, unlike lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    In Python, sets automatically remove duplicate values because they store only unique elements. If you try to add a duplicate value, Python will ignore it without raising an error.\n",
        "14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
        "\n",
        "    in  When used with a list, Python iterates through each element one by one until it finds a match.This means checking membership in a list has a time complexity of O(n) (slower for large lists).When used with a dictionary, the in keyword checks for the presence of a key (not values).\n",
        "15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not?\n",
        "\n",
        "    No, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple in Python because tuples are immutable.tuples are immutable because:\n",
        "    Memory Efficiency – Python optimizes tuples for performance since they do not change.Hashability – Tuples can be used as dictionary keys and set elements, unlike lists.Data Integrity – Prevents accidental modification of important data.Thread-Safety – Since tuples cannot change, they are safe in concurrent programming.\n",
        "16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n",
        "\n",
        "    A nested dictionary is a dictionary where one or more values are dictionaries themselves.\n",
        "    it is used in as:\n",
        "    A school database might store multiple students' details in a nested dictionary, with each student's name as the key and their information (like age, grade, and subjects) stored in another dictionary.\n",
        "    students = {\n",
        "    \"Alice\": {\"age\": 20, \"grade\": \"A\", \"subjects\": [\"Math\", \"Science\"]},\n",
        "    \"Bob\": {\"age\": 22, \"grade\": \"B\", \"subjects\": [\"History\", \"English\"]},\n",
        "    \"Charlie\": {\"age\": 21, \"grade\": \"A\", \"subjects\": [\"Physics\", \"Chemistry\"]}\n",
        "    }\n",
        "17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "    In Python, dictionaries use a hash table for storing key-value pairs, which allows for fast lookups.the average case O(1) and worst case O(n)\n",
        "18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
        "\n",
        "    the situations where order and index matters.Lists allow direct access via index (list[index]), whereas dictionaries require key lookups.where we need sorting , Lists have built-in sorting functions (sorted(), .sort()), while dictionaries require additional steps.\n",
        "19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval\n",
        "\n",
        "    Dictionaries in Python were traditionally unordered before Python 3.7. This means the key-value pairs were not stored in a fixed order, and retrieving elements didn’t necessarily follow the insertion order.These factors affect data retrieval, as dictionaries are accessed by key, meaning you cannot retrieve elements by index like in a list.In Python 3.6 and earlier, iterating over a dictionary could return elements in a different order than they were added.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.  Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "    data retrival in list is by index where as dictionary by key.ordering in key maintains insertion order where as dictionary maintains insertion order (since Python 3.7+) but is accessed by key.\n",
